# Color Symphony

Color Symphony is a simple, text-based memory game written in Pascal. The game challenges players to remember and repeat color patterns of increasing length.

In Color Symphony, players are presented with a sequence of colors and must repeat the sequence correctly. The game starts with a short sequence and gradually increases in difficulty as the player progresses through levels.

### Features:

- Four colors: Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow
- Increasing difficulty: The pattern length increases with each successful round
- Score tracking: Players earn points based on the number of successful rounds completed

## How to Play

1. Watch the color pattern displayed on the screen.
2. Repeat the pattern by pressing the corresponding keys:
 - ðŸ”´ R for Red 
 - ðŸŸ¢ G for Green 
 - ðŸ”µ B for Blue 
 - ðŸŸ¡ Y for Yellow 
    
3. If you repeat the pattern correctly, you'll advance to the next level with a longer pattern.
4. The game ends if you make a mistake in repeating the pattern.
